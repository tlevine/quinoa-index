## Running the Yoga script
Start selenium.

    java -jar bin/selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar

Run the downloader script.

    yoga/oh_just_use_selenium.py

This results in a `yoga/yoga.sqlite`. Copy this to `/tmp/yoga.sqlite`, then
parse the raw html downloads with

    parse_locations.py

Results will be in `/tmp/yoga.sqlite`; move that wherever you want to keep it.
